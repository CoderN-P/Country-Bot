# FAQ

## Before you use any commands please remember!

**When using a command, do NOT put any text inside of &lt;&gt; or \[\]**

## Why is the bot not responding to my commands?

Make sure that Country Bot has permission to send messages and has embed perms in the channel that you are using the bot commands in.

Make sure that you are using the correct prefix! Country Bot's default prefix is `.` To check the prefix again, just ping Country Bot  
  
Country Bot can also be offline or rebooted. If this is the case, Country Bot should be back up in less than 10 minutes

## Will I get any rewards from voting?

Yes! If you vote for Country Bot on [top.gg](https://top.gg), and you have created a country, you will receive extra coins and population

## Country Bot keeps saying: "Sorry \_\_ is not a country" even though it is a country!

This is a problem that we can't fix, so you will have to bear with us! Country Bot supports most countries but not all :\(

## I forgot Country Bot's prefix!

Don't worry! Just ping Country Bot and it will tell you its prefix.

## I was playing a guess\_capital game, but it paused while I was still playing!

This could have happened because the bot was restarted.
